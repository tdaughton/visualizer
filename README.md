Brett was nice enough to put a sample architecture for the program up. It is in your project folder/Extras, I believe.

To-Do:

- get LWJGL working -> Tess and Brett both have it (we think), just need to make sure Anand and Laurence have it to
- get basic sphere rotating
- make a parser to convert the latitude longtitude data to a spherical coordinate system
    (I've added the file that the previous group which contains latitude/longitude information about countries.
      Just to warn you, its pretty gnarly. The file is inside resources/model_resources/countries_world.xml and it is huge!
      No worries, we can all tackle it together if necessary)
- implement basic structure on git and create work partitions
To be continued...
**Please add anything I forgot!! **
